    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The main goal of the game is to outscore the opposing team by making more successful shots (baskets) into their hoop. A
    basket can either be worth 2 points (inside the three-point line), 3 points (outside the three-point line), or 1 point
    (from free throws).</p>

    <h2>Team Composition</h2>
    <p>Each team consists of 5 players on the court at a time. Traditionally, it is composed of the following:</p>
    <p><strong>Point Guard</strong>: Often the leader on the floor, handles the ball and sets up plays.</p>
    <p><strong>Shooting Guard</strong>: Strong shooter, often responsible for scoring points.</p>
    <p><strong>Small Foward</strong>: A versatile player who can score, defend, and rebound.</p>
    <p><strong>Power Foward</strong>: Plays near the basket, both scoring and rebounding.</p>
    <p><strong>Center</strong>: Usually the tallest player, responsible for rebounding and protecting the basket.</p>
    <p>However, it does not mean that you play a specific position that you can not have skillsets from other positions. A position is simply a role, you do not have to follow it.</p>
    <h2>Basic Violations</h2>
   <p><strong>Traveling</strong>: A player moves without dribbling, taking more than two steps while holding the ball.</p>
    <p><strong>Double Dribble</strong>: A player dribbles, stops, and then begins dribbling again.</p>
    <p><strong>Carrying/Palming</strong>: When a player turns their hand too far under the ball while dribbling, it is considered carrying or
    palming the ball, and it results in a turnover.</p>
    <p><strong>Goaltending</strong>: If a player blocks a shot on its way down toward the basket or while it is on the rim, it's considered
    goaltending, and the shot is counted.</p>
    <p><strong>Foul</strong>: A player commits a foul when they make illegal physical contact with an opponent. For example,
    pushing, hitting, or blocking a player from behind.</p>
