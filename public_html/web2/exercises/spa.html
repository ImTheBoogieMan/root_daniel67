    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The main goal of the game is to outscore the opposing team by making more successful shots (baskets) into their hoop. A
    basket can either be worth 2 points (inside the three-point line), 3 points (outside the three-point line), or 1 point
    (from free throws).</p>
    <h2>Teams</h2>
    <p>Team Composition: Each team consists of 5 players on the court at a time. Traditionally, it is composed of the following:
    Point guard: Often the leader on the floor, handles the ball and sets up plays.
    Shooting guard: Strong shooter, often responsible for scoring points.
    Small forward: A versatile player who can score, defend, and rebound.
    Power forward: Plays near the basket, both scoring and rebounding.
    Center: Usually the tallest player, responsible for rebounding and protecting the basket.
    however, it does not mean that you play one position that you can not have skillsets from other positions. A position is simply a role, you do not have to follow it.</p>
    <h2>The Court</h2>
    <p>Dimensions: A standard basketball court is 94 feet long and 50 feet wide (NBA). For high school courts, the dimensions
    are usually 84 feet long and 50 feet wide.
    Markings:
    The Hoop: 10 feet off the ground.
    Three-Point Line: A curved line around the basket; shots made beyond it are worth 3 points.
    Free Throw Line: 15 feet from the basket; used for free throws.
    The Paint/Key: The rectangular area around the basket, where players can not stay for more than 3 seconds (offensive
    players).</p>
