      <div class="insidewhite">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The main goal of the game is to outscore the opposing team by making
          more successful shots (baskets) into their hoop. A basket can either
          be worth 2 points (inside the three-point line), 3 points (outside the
          three-point line), or 1 point (from free throws).
        </p>
        <aside><img id="right" src="../images/positions.png" alt="" /></aside>
        <h2>Team Composition</h2>
        <p>
          Each team consists of 5 players on the court at a time. Traditionally,
          it is composed of the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Point Guard</strong>: Often the leader on the floor, handles
          the ball and sets up plays.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shooting Guard</strong>: Strong shooter, often responsible for
          scoring points.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Small Foward</strong>: A versatile player who can score,
          defend, and rebound.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Power Foward</strong>: Plays near the basket, both scoring and
          rebounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Center</strong>: Usually the tallest player, responsible for
          rebounding and protecting the basket.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, it does not mean that you play a specific position that you
          can not have skillsets from other positions. A position is simply a
          role, you do not have to follow it.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic Violations</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Traveling</strong>: A player moves without dribbling, taking
          more than two steps while holding the ball.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Double Dribble</strong>: A player dribbles, stops, and then
          begins dribbling again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Carrying/Palming</strong>: When a player turns their hand too
          far under the ball while dribbling, it is considered carrying or
          palming the ball, and it results in a turnover.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Goaltending</strong>: If a player blocks a shot on its way
          down toward the basket or while it is on the rim, it's considered
          goaltending, and the shot is counted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Foul</strong>: A player commits a foul when they make illegal
          physical contact with an opponent. For example, pushing, hitting, or
          blocking a player from behind.

        <h2>The Toronto Raptors</h2>
        <p>
          The Toronto Raptors is a team currently retooling, meaning that they
          are fixing up their roster without necessarily clearing out their
          whole roster. The pieces that this team is building around now
          consists of their franchise cornerstone Scottie Barnes, their recently
          acquired trade piece Brandon Ingram, the Toronto native RJ Barrett and
          the crafty shot creating Gradey Dick, just to name some of their key
          players. This squad is led by coach Darko Rajakovic, his 2nd year as
          the Raptors head coach.

        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <p>
          Analysing their roster construction, first thing that pops out is that
          this team is young. The average age between everyone getting playing
          time is 24.7 years old with an average of 4 years of experience.
          Another key element that you would realize as soon as you watch their
          games is that they play with a fast pace, putting emphasis on playing
          with energy on defense and utilizing a LOT of movement on their half
          court offense. One key element of them being able to run a very
          complex offense is the personnel that can handle the ball and execute
          plays. Their superstar, Scottie Barnes, is elite when it comes to
          leading an offense and creating for others, since his playmaking
          abilities are extraordinary. In addition to their star player being a
          great passer, their other pieces are also capable of running the
          offense. For example, RJ Barrett can run an offense, because he had
          made strides as a playmaker. Another strength about this team is their
          coach. Darko Rajakovic is known as one of the best development coaches
          out there, while also being known for defending his players when
          needed to (refer to this video). This leads to having a squad that
          would buy in with whatever scheme you want to execute.
        </p>
        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>
          One of this team’s weaknesses is their defense. Although they do have
          some plus defenders such as Scottie Barnes and Ochai Agbaji, this team
          lacks personnel and size to become an, at the very least, average
          defense. This team ranks 26th in defensive rating, which means they
          are genuinely BAD on that end of the floor. Another weakness of this
          team is their inexperience. Since most of the players are young, they
          are more prone to make boneheaded plays and being lost on defense.
          This is easily solved by giving them more game experience. One final
          element that is glairing in this team is their injury luck. This team
          has had a fully healthy starting lineup in only 6 games out of 55
          games played at the times this was written (2/20/2025). It speaks
          volumes to how unlucky this team is this year.
        </p>
        <h2>Overall</h2>
        <p>
          Although they are at the bottom of the NBA standings, this basically
          guarantees them one of the top prospects in the 2025 NBA draft, which
          is known for being a VERY stacked class. With the improvements that
          everybody is making, then adding a top draft pick, this team’s future
          is very bright, to the point where they might even make the playoffs
          as soon as next season.
