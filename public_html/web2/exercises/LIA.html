                <p class="side">I have 8 years of long distance biking experience. I have gotten gravely hurt because of it
                and I experienced my best moment too. I
                have always enjoyed biking and I do not plan on giving up on biking. I have biked to very far places,
                like Brossard,
                Trois-Rivieres and Oka. Therefore, I think I am qualified to teach about the Do's and Dont's about
                biking. Although I am not a professional in any way, shape or form, I make it up with experience. </p>

        <h1 id="Pre" class="top">Precautions</h1>
        <article class="content">
            <p class="center">Even though it may seem like the rules only apply to cars and pedestrians, there are also rules to follow
                for bikers in
                Montreal. There are also multiple precautions that you should take before biking around town. This
                section will cover
                both of those, to ensure that you will have a safe trip.</p>

        <h1 class="minitop">Safety</h1>
        <article class="content">
                <img class="img" src="../images/safety.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Making sure that you are safe to bike around the area should be your number one
                    priority before anything else. You need
                    to see if the road is bumpy, the time of day that you will be biking, the surrounding area, etc. It
                    is always
                    recommended to wear a helmet that is not damaged, since a damaged helmet defeats the purpose of
                    wearing one, which is to
                    distribute the shock of the collision from your head to the helmet. Another good safety precaution
                    is to invest in a
                    bike lock. There will be times where you want to go inside a store, but you can not bring your bike.
                    With a bike lock,
                    you can leave it out there without risking someone taking it nonchalantly. One final thing that you
                    should consider
                    before leaving is the weather. Bad weather can cause the roads to be slippery, hence making it
                    harder to bike on.</p>

    <article class="content">
        <p class="center">Montreal is a great place to bike in overall. It has plenty of bike lanes available to cyclists inside the greater Montreal area and outside of Montreal, like in Laval, Brossard and Deux-Montagnes.
