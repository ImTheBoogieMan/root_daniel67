    <p class="text">I have 8 years of long distance biking experience. I have gotten gravely hurt because of it and I experienced my best moment too. I
    have always enjoyed biking and I do not plan on giving up on biking. I have biked to very far places, like Brossard,
    Trois-Rivieres and Oka. Therefore, I think I am qualified to teach about the Do's and Dont's about biking. Although I am not a professional in any way, shape or form, I make it up with experience. </p></article>
