<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A man goes to sit on his bed and wears his headphones in his bedroom. The song starts playing and he goes in this sort of outerspace experience while serenading something. Some of the shots are of the man in space. Few shots later, it is revealed that he was serenading a plushie, scene is back in the bedroom, kicking his feet in the air.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The man is more of a calm and settled looking kind of man in the beginning. However, he starts going more into a love delusions as he falls deeper in the rabbit hole. It is to a point where the man kicks his feet in the air while serenading the plushie. The plushie is a reference to a meme about a beaver wearing glasses (Shown below).</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Underneath is the inspiration for the video. I took the concept of someone being in a different dimension after listening to music and added my own twist to it. For example, I changed the location, the scenario and added some details that weren't in the original video. The story is also loosely inspired by someone I know, who is a hopeless romantic. He would serenade his plushies when I would FaceTime him. I find it comical and funny and wanted to interept that as an animation. I will most likely use premiere pro to add the music and the effects in the music.</p>
